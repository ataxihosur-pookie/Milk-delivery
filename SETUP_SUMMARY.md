- `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `SETUP_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## ⚠️ What You Need to Do

### The Blocker
The current `.env` file contains credentials for a Supabase project that **doesn't exist**:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://0ec90b57d6e95fcbda19832f.supabase.co
```

This project is either deleted or was never created. The application cannot connect to the database until you create a real Supabase project.

### The Solution (3 Simple Steps)

**Step 1: Create Supabase Project**
- Visit https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Click "New Project"
- Set name, password, region
- Wait 2-3 minutes for provisioning

**Step 2: Get Credentials**
- Go to Settings → API
- Copy Project URL
- Copy anon/public key

**Step 3: Apply Database**
- Update `.env` with new credentials
- Open Supabase SQL Editor
- Copy & paste `complete_schema.sql`
- Click Run

## 📊 Database Statistics

Once setup is complete, you'll have:
- **18 tables** for complete supply chain management
- **45+ RLS policies** for security
- **30+ indexes** for performance
- **3 utility functions** for automation
- **Multiple triggers** for timestamp updates
